## Airline Reservation System


# 1. Introduction

This Project is a desktop application where the airline reservation system is coded with
C# programming language. The application starts with a login form that leads to a login form.
The login form will be given an authentication mechanism, if the user id and password match
the condition, the user will login to the main form. The user can navigate to the Trains form
from the main form. Can add, edit, delete and view trains. User can manage different
Passengers, add, edit or update Passenger. The user can manage different Trips that allocate a
particular train to them. User can add, edit and delete Trips. The User can Book a Ticket for a
particular Trip. Finally, the user can cancel a reservation.

## 1.1. Purpose of the system
The airline reservation system includes details about flight schedules, passenger
reservations and ticket registrations.

## 1.2. Scope of the system
The users of the system consist of the system administrator and registrar. The
aircraft, passengers, travel and reservation information in the system are under the
control of the system users.

# 2. Current System
In several countries, if someone wants to book a flight ticket, they follow one of these
things: Elle goes to the airport and book the ticket. Downloading the ticket as a paper
document. Fill out the ticket from the System and print it out and deliver it to the airport.
Booking the ticket online at some registered ticket offices. Even the above approaches arebooking tickets online, not completely online. The traveler may not have much freedom over
this approach. Therefore, the Passenger may or may not be satisfied with this approach as it
involves manual intervention such as traveling to the airport to book their ticket.

# 3. Proposed System
The proposed system provides complete freedom for the user, where the user can log in
to this application and book her ticket on her own system.
